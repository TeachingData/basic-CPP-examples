# basic-CPP-examples
Repository of C++ example programs used in lectures or as supplements for teaching various programming methodologies.

1. **Lecture 1** focused on different output methods with variables using 2 types that are (typically) less explored in intro courses.
2. **Lecture** 2: Introduced std::array over c-style arrays, reviewed while & for(each) loops, and reviews controls structures (if/else)
3. _Lecture_ 3: Introduced vectors and reviews control structures (switch) by updating Lecture 2's code
4. _VectorPart1_ is a version of the completed homework; Lecture 4 adds a few functions to rock, paper, scissors
5. _SchedulerPart1_: First version which students will use to complete an assignment.
6.__ _Header _Directory__: Directory with first header introductory code
7. _StructureExample_: A very basic example of a structure and passing by reference (there are 2)
8. _Mobile Class_: This just shows very basic class structure with basic overloading and overriding
9. _WalkingTheScreen_: This shows moving using Keyboard events, moving items in an array, using abstract classes and project structure
