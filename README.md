# basic-CPP-examples
Repository of C++ example programs used in lectures or as supplements for teaching various programming methodologies.

1. *Lecture 1: focused on different output methods with variables using 2 types that are (typically) less explored in intro courses.*
2. *Lecture 2: Introduced std::array over c-style arrays, reviewed while & for(each) loops, and reviews controls structures (if/else)*
3. *Lecture 3: Introduced vectors and reviews control structures (switch) by updating Lecture 2's code*
4. VectorPart1 is a version of the completed homework; Lecture 4 adds a few functions to rock, paper, scissors
5. SchedulerPart1: First version which students will use to complete an assignment.
6. Header Directory: Directory with first header introductory code
7. StructureExample: A very basic example of a structure and passing by reference (there are 2)
8. Mobile Class: This just shows very basic class structure with basic overloading and overriding
9. WalkingTheScreen: This shows moving using Keyboard events, moving items in an array, using abstract classes and project structure
