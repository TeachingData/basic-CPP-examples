## Shows two types of inheritence
  - Code from 2018 class on direct inheritance using a Person -> Student and Person -> Staff example.
      - All classes are included in Person.cpp for this iteration.
      - Composition used with Name and other structs
      - No virtualization just direct overridding and parent-child relationships
  - Code from 2020 class with more detailed example
      - Uses a File abstract with virtualization for its parent
      - More traditional header/source split that one would expect in professional code
      - 2 children: a CSV file handler and a book file handler
      - Structure Journal is used to show composition in CSV handler
      - Also has a small string stream usage shown with CSV spliting
